# GSchat
A real Time Chat Application that can be used to communicate with one or more individuals simultaneously. To properly implement the application, follow the instructions in the "INSTRUCTIONS" file of the repository.
# How to use
 Anyone looking to implement this application can do so in two ways
 1) Go to my Replit Profile: @Gauthams2004, open the 2 repls, titled "FrontEnd" and "server" click.
    Click the "RUN" button on both repls.
 2) Try accessing the application by opening these two links:
     frontend.gauthams2004.repl.co
    and
    server.gauthams2004.repl.co
